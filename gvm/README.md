# Run GVM（Greenbone Vulnerability Management）
OpenVAS has been renamed GVM (greenbone vulnerability management) since version 10. The latest version of GVM v20.8.0 is used in this paper. Therefore, the word "OpenVAS" no longer appears and is uniformly called GVM
OpenVAS从版本10开始，OpenVAS被改名为GVM（Greenbone Vulnerability Management），本文使用的是最新版的GVM v20.8.0，因此不再出现“OpenVAS”字样，统一叫GVM
