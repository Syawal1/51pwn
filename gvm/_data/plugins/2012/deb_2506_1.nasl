policy and execute cross-site script (XSS) attacks through properly crafted
HTML documents.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.12-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.6-1.

version 2.6.6-1.

In testing and unstable distribution, the source package has been renamed to
modsecurity-apache.");
