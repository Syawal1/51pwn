  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN
  packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted
  traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-1576)

  Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly
  parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices
  could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.
  (CVE-2011-1776)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not
  correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
  consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2213)

  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
  certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
  could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
  privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)

  Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not
  correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was
  available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain
  root privileges. (CVE-2011-2700)

  Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when
  Generic Receive Offload (CVE-2011-2723)

  Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
  filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
  filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-2928)

  Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
  number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
  sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)

  Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
  large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
  to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
