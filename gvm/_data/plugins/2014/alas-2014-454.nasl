This vulnerability could allow a malicious image creator to loosen the restrictions applied to a container's processes, potentially facilitating a break-out.  (CVE-2014-6408 )The Docker engine, up to and including version 1.3.1, was vulnerable to extracting files to arbitrary paths on the host during 'docker pull' and 'docker load' operations. This was caused by symlink and hardlink traversals present in Docker's image extraction. This vulnerability could be leveraged to perform remote code execution and privilege escalation.
