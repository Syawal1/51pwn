SQL statement.

Features include an intuitive web interface, support for most MySQL features

drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes, maintenance
server, databases and tables, with proposals on server configuration, execute,
edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch-queries, manage MySQL users
and privileges, manage stored procedures and triggers), import data from CSV
and SQL, export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, PDF, OpenDocument Text
and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel, LATEX and others, administering multiple servers,
creating PDF graphics of your database layout, creating complex queries using
Query-by-example (QBE), searching globally in a database or a subset of it,
transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link and much more...");
