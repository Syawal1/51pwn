A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending a specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2020-12352)

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP packets with A2MP CID. A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to crash the system causing denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-12351)

A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernels Bluetooth implementation processed extended advertising report events. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or to potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted Bluetooth packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-24490)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Traffic between two Geneve endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.(CVE-2020-25645)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-14331)

A missing CAP_NET_RAW check in NFC socket creation in ne
fc/rawsock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.2 could be used by local attackers to create raw sockets, bypassing security mechanisms, aka CID-26896f01467a.(CVE-2020-26088)
