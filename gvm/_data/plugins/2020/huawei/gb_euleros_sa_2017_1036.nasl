  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Multiple integer overflows in the (1) curl_escape, (2) curl_easy_escape, (3) curl_unescape, and (4) curl_easy_unescape functions in libcurl before 7.50.3 allow attackers to have unspecified impact via a string of length 0xffffffff, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.(CVE-2016-7167)

A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51. If cookie state is written into a cookie jar file that is later read back and used for subsequent requests, a malicious HTTP server can inject new cookies for arbitrary domains into said cookie jar.(CVE-2016-8615)

A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.(CVE-2016-8616)

The base64 encode function in curl before version 7.51.0 is prone to a buffer being under allocated in 32bit systems if it receives at least 1Gb as input via `CURLOPT_USERNAME`.(CVE-2016-8617)

The libcurl API function called `curl_maprintf()` before version 7.51.0 can be tricked into doing a double-free due to an unsafe `size_t` multiplication, on systems using 32 bit `size_t` variables.(CVE-2016-8618)

The function `read_data()` in security.c in curl before version 7.51.0 is vulnerable to memory double free.(CVE-2016-8619)

The `curl_getdate` function in curl before version 7.51.0 is vulnerable to an out of bounds read if it receives an input with one digit short.(CVE-2016-8621)

The URL percent-encoding decode function in libcurl before 7.51.0 is called `curl_easy_unescape`. Internally, even if this function would be made to allocate a unscape destination buffer larger than 2GB, it would return that new length in a signed 32 bit integer variable, thus the length would get either just truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That could then lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.(CVE-2016-8622)

A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0. The way curl handles cookies permits other threads to trigger a use-after-free leading to information disclosure.(CVE-2016-8623)

curl before version 7.51.0 doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character, and could instead be tricked into connecting to a different host. This may have security implications if you for example use an URL parser that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains before using curl to request them.(CVE-2016-8624)");
