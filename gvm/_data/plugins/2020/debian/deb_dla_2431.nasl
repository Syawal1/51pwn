expressions library, notably used in PHP mbstring.

CVE-2019-13224

A use-after-free in onig_new_deluxe() in regext.c allows
attackers to potentially cause information disclosure, denial of
service, or possibly code execution by providing a crafted regular
expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern and a
string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by
onig_new_deluxe().

CVE-2019-16163

Oniguruma allows Stack Exhaustion in regcomp.c because of recursion
in regparse.c.

CVE-2019-19012

An integer overflow in the search_in_range function in regexec.c in
Onigurama leads to an out-of-bounds read, in which the offset of
this read is under the control of an attacker. (This only affects
the 32-bit compiled version). Remote attackers can cause a
denial-of-service or information disclosure, or possibly have
unspecified other impact, via a crafted regular expression.

CVE-2019-19203

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma. In the function
gb18030_mbc_enc_len in file gb18030.c, a UChar pointer is
dereferenced without checking if it passed the end of the matched
string. This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.

CVE-2019-19204

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma. In the function
fetch_interval_quantifier (formerly known as fetch_range_quantifier)
in regparse.c, PFETCH is called without checking PEND. This leads to
a heap-based buffer over-read.

CVE-2019-19246

Oniguruma has a heap-based buffer over-read in str_lower_case_match
in regexec.c.

CVE-2020-26159

In Oniguruma an attacker able to supply a regular expression for
compilation may be able to overflow a buffer by one byte in
concat_opt_exact_str in src/regcomp.c");
