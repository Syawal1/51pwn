CVE-2020-9497

Apache Guacamole does not properly validate data received from RDP
servers via static virtual channels. If a user connects to a
malicious or compromised RDP server, specially-crafted PDUs could
result in disclosure of information within the memory of the guacd
process handling the connection.

CVE-2020-9498

Apache Guacamole may mishandle pointers involved in processing data
received via RDP static virtual channels. If a user connects to a
malicious or compromised RDP server, a series of specially-crafted
PDUs could result in memory corruption, possibly allowing arbitrary
code to be executed with the privileges of the running guacd
process.");
