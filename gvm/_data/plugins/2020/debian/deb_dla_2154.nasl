CVE-2020-10802

In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5, a SQL injection vulnerability
has been discovered where certain parameters are not properly
escaped when generating certain queries for search actions in
libraries/classes/Controllers/Table/TableSearchController.php.
An attacker can generate a crafted database or table name. The
attack can be performed if a user attempts certain search
operations on the malicious database or table.

CVE-2020-10803

In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5, a SQL injection vulnerability
was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger
an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in
tbl_get_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php).
The attacker must be able to insert crafted data into certain
database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the
Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack.");
