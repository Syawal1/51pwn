CVE-2018-20852

By using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are
meant for other domains.

CVE-2019-5010

NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
(credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
hostname). A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to
locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or
a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an
HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
(e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different
host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly
parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and
implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message
could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be
denied.

CVE-2019-20907

Opening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to
missing header validation.");
