CVE-2020-9484

When using Apache Tomcat and an attacker is able to control the
contents and name of a file on the server, and b) the server is
configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore, and c)
the PersistenceManager is configured with
sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter='null' (the default unless a
SecurityManager is used) or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the
attacker provided object to be deserialized, and d) the attacker
knows the relative file path from the storage location used by
FileStore to the file the attacker has control over, then, using a
specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to trigger
remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their
control. Note that all of conditions a) to d) must be true for the
attack to succeed.

CVE-2020-11996

A specially crafted sequence of HTTP/2 requests sent to Apache
Tomcat could trigger high CPU usage for several seconds. If a
sufficient number of such requests were made on concurrent HTTP/2
connections, the server could become unresponsive.");
