CVE-2005-1513

Integer overflow in the stralloc_readyplus function in qmail,
when running on 64 bit platforms with a large amount of virtual
memory, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large SMTP request.

CVE-2005-1514

commands.c in qmail, when running on 64 bit platforms with a
large amount of virtual memory, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a long SMTP command without a space character, which causes
an array to be referenced with a negative index.

CVE-2005-1515

Integer signedness error in the qmail_put and substdio_put
functions in qmail, when running on 64 bit platforms with a
large amount of virtual memory, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a large number of SMTP RCPT TO commands.

CVE-2020-3811

qmail-verify as used in netqmail 1.06 is prone to a
mail-address verification bypass vulnerability.

CVE-2020-3812

qmail-verify as used in netqmail 1.06 is prone to an
information disclosure vulnerability. A local attacker can
test for the existence of files and directories anywhere in
the filesystem because qmail-verify runs as root and tests
for the existence of files in the attacker's home directory,
without dropping its privileges first.");
