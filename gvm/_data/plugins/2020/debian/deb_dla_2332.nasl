CVE-2020-12862

An out-of-bounds read in SANE Backends before 1.0.30 may allow a

An out-of-bounds read in SANE Backends before 1.0.30 may allow a
malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim
to read important information, such as the ASLR offsets of the
program, aka GHSL-2020-083.

CVE-2020-12865

A heap buffer overflow in SANE Backends before 1.0.30 may allow a
malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim
to execute arbitrary code, aka GHSL-2020-084.

CVE-2020-12867

A NULL pointer dereference in sanei_epson_net_read in SANE
Backends before 1.0.30 allows a malicious device connected to the
same local network as the victim to cause a denial of service, aka
GHSL-2020-075.");
