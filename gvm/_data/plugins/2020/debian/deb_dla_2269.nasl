CVE-2020-4046

In affected versions of WordPress, users with low
privileges (like contributors and authors) can use the
embed block in a certain way to inject unfiltered HTML
in the block editor. When affected posts are viewed by a
higher privileged user, this could lead to script
execution in the editor/wp-admin.

CVE-2020-4047

In affected versions of WordPress, authenticated users with
upload permissions (like authors) are able to inject
JavaScript into some media file attachment pages in a certain
way. This can lead to script execution in the context of a
higher privileged user when the file is viewed by them.

CVE-2020-4048

In affected versions of WordPress, due to an issue in
wp_validate_redirect() and URL sanitization, an arbitrary
external link can be crafted leading to unintended/open
redirect when clicked.

CVE-2020-4049

In affected versions of WordPress, when uploading themes, the
name of the theme folder can be crafted in a way that could
lead to JavaScript execution in /wp-admin on the themes page.
This does require an admin to upload the theme, and is low
severity self-XSS.

CVE-2020-4050

In affected versions of WordPress, misuse of the
`set-screen-option` filter's return value allows arbitrary
user meta fields to be saved. It does require an admin to
install a plugin that would misuse the filter. Once installed,
it can be leveraged by low privileged users.");
