CVE-2020-3327

A vulnerability in the ARJ archive parsing module in Clam
AntiVirus (ClamAV) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected
device. The vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow read.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
ARJ file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the
attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting
in a denial of service condition.

CVE-2020-3341

A vulnerability in the PDF archive parsing module in Clam
AntiVirus (ClamAV) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected
device. The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow read.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the
attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting
in a denial of service condition.");
