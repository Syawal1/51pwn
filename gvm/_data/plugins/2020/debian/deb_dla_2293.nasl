CVE-2017-17458

In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially
malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run
arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script
checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents
construction of such repositories, but they can be created
programmatically.

CVE-2018-13346

The mpatch_apply function in mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1
incorrectly proceeds in cases where the fragment start is past the
end of the original data.

CVE-2018-13347

mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1 mishandles integer addition and
subtraction.

CVE-2018-13348

The mpatch_decode function in mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1
mishandles certain situations where there should be at least 12
bytes remaining after the current position in the patch data, but
actually are not.

CVE-2018-1000132

Mercurial version 4.5 and earlier contains a Incorrect Access
Control (CWE-285) vulnerability in Protocol server that can result
in Unauthorized data access. This attack appear to be exploitable
via network connectivity. This vulnerability appears to have been
fixed in 4.5.1.

CVE-2019-3902

Symbolic links and subrepositories could be used defeat Mercurial's
path-checking logic and write files outside the repository root.");
