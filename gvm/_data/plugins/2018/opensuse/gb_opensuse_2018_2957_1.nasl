  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"This update for openssl fixes the following issues:

  These security issues were fixed:

  - Prevent One&amp Done side-channel attack on RSA that allowed physically near
  attackers to use EM emanations to recover information (bsc#1104789)

  - CVE-2018-0737: The RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be
  vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with
  sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key
  generation process could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)

  These non-security issues were fixed:

  - Add openssl(cli) Provide so the packages that require the openssl binary
  can require this instead of the new openssl meta package (bsc#1101470)

  - Fixed path to the engines which are under /lib64 on SLE-12 (bsc#1101246,
  bsc#997043)

  This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update update project.

  Patch Instructions:

  To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended
  installation methods
  like YaST online_update or 'zypper patch'.

  Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:

  - openSUSE Leap 42.3:

  zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2018-1091=1");
