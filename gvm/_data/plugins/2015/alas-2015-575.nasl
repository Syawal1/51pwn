This could cause an application using GnuTLS to incorrectly accept a certificate as valid when its issuing CA is already expired. (CVE-2014-8155 )It was found that GnuTLS did not verify whether a hashing algorithm listed in a signature matched the hashing algorithm listed in the certificate. An attacker could create a certificate that used a different hashing algorithm than it claimed, possibly causing GnuTLS to use an insecure, disallowed hashing algorithm during certificate verification. (CVE-2015-0282 )It was discovered that GnuTLS did not check if all sections of X.509 certificates indicate the same signature algorithm. This flaw, in combination with a different flaw, could possibly lead to a bypass of the certificate signature check. (CVE-2015-0294 )");
