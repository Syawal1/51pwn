It was discovered that a compromised content process could log in to a
malicious Firefox Sync account. An attacker could potentially exploit
this, in combination with another vulnerability, to disable the sandbox.
(CVE-2019-9812)

It was discovered that addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com could
be loaded in to the same content process. An attacker could potentially
exploit this, in combination with another vulnerability that allowed a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, to modify browser settings.
(CVE-2019-11741)

It was discovered that the 'Forget about this site' feature in the
history pane removes HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings for
sites on the pre-load list. An attacker could potentially exploit this
to bypass the protections offered by HSTS. (CVE-2019-11747)");
