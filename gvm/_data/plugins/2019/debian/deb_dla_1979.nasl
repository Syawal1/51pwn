classroom management software. All vulnerabilities referenced below are
issues that have originally been reported against Debian source package
libvncserver. The italc source package in Debian ships a custom-patched
version of libvncserver, thus libvncserver's security fixes required
porting over.

CVE-2014-6051

Integer overflow in the MallocFrameBuffer function in vncviewer.c in
LibVNCServer allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly executed arbitrary code via an advertisement for
a large screen size, which triggered a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2014-6052

The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in
LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which
allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large
screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3)
PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.

CVE-2014-6053

The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2014-6054

The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and server crash) via
a zero value in the scaling factor in a (1) PalmVNCSetScaleFactor or
(2) SetScale message.

CVE-2014-6055

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the File Transfer feature in
rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote authenticated users to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a (1) long file or (2) directory name or the (3) FileTime
attribute in a rfbFileTransferOffer message.

CVE-2016-9941

Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in
LibVNCServer allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the
client drawing area.

CVE-2016-9942

Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
payload decompressed length exceeded what is specified by the t ...
