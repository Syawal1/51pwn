CVE-2019-19012

An integer overflow in the search_in_range function in regexec.c
leads to an out-of-bounds read, in which the offset of this read
is under the control of an attacker. (This only affects the 32-bit
compiled version). Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service
or information disclosure, or possibly have unspecified other
impact, via a crafted regular expression.

CVE-2019-19204

In the function fetch_range_quantifier in regparse.c, PFETCH is
called without checking PEND. This leads to a heap-based buffer
over-read and lead to denial-of-service via a crafted regular
expression.

CVE-2019-19246

Heap-based buffer over-read in str_lower_case_match in regexec.c
can lead to denial-of-service via a crafted regular expression.");
