CVE-2016-6352
fix for denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) via
crafted dimensions in an ICO file

CVE-2017-2870
Fix for an exploitable integer overflow vulnerability in the
tiff_image_parse functionality. When software is compiled with
clang, A specially crafted tiff file can cause a heap-overflow
resulting in remote code execution. Debian package is compiled
with gcc and is not affected, but probably some downstream is.

CVE-2017-6312
Fix for an integer overflow in io-ico.c that allows attackers
to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and application
crash) via a crafted image

CVE-2017-6313
Fix for an integer underflow in the load_resources function in
io-icns.c that allows attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read and program crash) via a crafted image entry
size in an ICO file

CVE-2017-6314
Fix for an infinite loop in the make_available_at_least function
in io-tiff.c that allows attackers to cause a denial of service
via a large TIFF file.");
