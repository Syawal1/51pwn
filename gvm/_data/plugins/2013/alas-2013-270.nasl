If an application used such a function, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332 )A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash. (CVE-2013-0242 )It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914 )");
